Additional guidelines:

- Use age-appropriate language for the specified class level
- Ensure questions test understanding rather than mere factual recall
- Avoid ambiguous or tricky wording
- Make all answer options roughly the same length
- Don't use "All of the above" or "None of the above" as options
- Vary the difficulty level of questions to assess different cognitive skills (e.g., knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis)
- Include a mix of question types (e.g., definition, concept application, problem-solving) when appropriate for the subject
- Ensure questions are culturally sensitive and inclusive

Before providing the questions, briefly analyze the subject and class level to tailor the content appropriately. Then, generate the specified number of multiple-choice questions based on these guidelines.`
